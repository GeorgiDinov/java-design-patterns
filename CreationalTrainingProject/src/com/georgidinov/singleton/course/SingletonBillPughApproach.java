//Improvement over the "Eager Evaluation" approach
//The key thing here is even though the inner class is static
//IT WON'T BE LOADED IN MEMORY BY THE "JVM"
//UNTIL THAT INSTANCE IS NEEDED VIA THE getInstance() method
//WHEN getInstance() is CALLED THE "JVM" WILL  LOAD THE INNER CLASS in memory
//AND THE INSTANCE WILL BE CRATED
//It is thread safe, because there is only one instance
//and saves resources because it is loaded in
//memory when the client need it(call it, On Demand)
//
//***According to the instructor in the
//***design pattern course
//***this is the preferred approach from all java developers
