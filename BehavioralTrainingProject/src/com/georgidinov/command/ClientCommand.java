//Command Design Pattern
//Strong decoupling every message(method call) between objects is transferred into objects
//Main participants are:
//  The Receiver -> receives(executes) all the messages(Commands) in the form of objects
//called(forwarded) from the Invoker
//for each method in the receiver class there is corresponding class(concrete implementation)
//of the  Command interface  and every concrete implementation "HAS A" Receiver member variable
//inside the execute method the receiver calls its  corresponding(mind the class name) method;
//  The Invoker "HAS A" Command member variable or list of Command type
//sends calls to the Receiver via the command member variable
//  The Command is object who has specific method invocation purpose
//the method call is wrapped in object and that object is the Command interface
//concrete implementation
//
