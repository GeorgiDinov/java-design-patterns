//  Memento Design Pattern
//Single state(memento) implementation
//Used for restoring previous states / state of an object
//Not recommended if this is heavy and memory consuming operation
//
//  Participants: Originator, Memento, Caretaker
//
//->Originator is the object which state we want so save / store
//-->Memento is the object that is storing the Originator state
//      in this example the Memento is an inner class
//--->Caretaker is the object which handles the Memento object / objects
//  the Caretaker, does not modify the memento object / objects he is just passing them around
//  It holds object reference to the saved memento or entire list / stack
//  of memento objects(states of the Originator)
//two methods that take Originator object as a parameter
//one for storing the current state, one for restoring state
//with the stacked example will see method which can restore specific states
//->The Originator also has two methods one to create his Memento and one
// that takes a Memento object and use to restore it's state
