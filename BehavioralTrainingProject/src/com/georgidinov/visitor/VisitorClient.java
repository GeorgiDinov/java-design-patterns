//Visitor Design Pattern
//When you have a structure of objects and you want to extend their functionality
//without touching the objects, nor the structure we can apply the Visitor Design Pattern
//So the class who holds the objects may not have method for calculating like in our case
//price for something based on some object property of the Elements(objects) this object holds
//this may not be the one thing we want to do to extend our functionality
//and the Element holding object may become complex and dependable
//Here we "Program to an Interface" with both interfaces Element and Visitor
//We maintain the "Open Closed Principle" (open for extension, closed for modification)
//So the Elements may be different but if they Implement the Element interface with the
//--------accept(Visitor) method and pass itself to the Visitor visit(Element) method
//the Visitor will extend the functionality of that object by performing some operations
//In our example we have two not very related objects, but they implement the Element interface
// and accept Visitor/s , then in the Visitor interface we have overloaded visit methods
//that accept as parameters each of the concrete objects that implement the Element interface
//
//>>>while traversing through we call the accept method on every object and the right
//visit method gets executed
//
//We can easily extend the number of concrete visitors,
// and the objects to be visited(programing to an interface)
//
