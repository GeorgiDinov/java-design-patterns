//The idea is to represent group of similar objects as one
//Define component interface and classes which will implement it are either Leafs(no children) or
//Composite(with children) -> I am using tree like representation
//The idea is that the client that uses the component interface can interact with Leaf of Composite object
//in the same way
//In this implementation of the pattern there is slightly different approach of the primary option
//Because there will be "trade off's" in the "original" variation the interface will have to define methods
//for add, get, remove and some other common operations
//but classes implementing the interface which are Leafs won't use at least add, get and remove operations
//this violates two principles "The interface segregation principle" and "The single responsibility principle"
//in our implementation we kind of force the client to know a bit more of the composite class(class Supervisor)
//and all of the methods for the add, remove and delete operations are defined and implemented in it
//so the client has to know more about the composite class which will make things more coupled
