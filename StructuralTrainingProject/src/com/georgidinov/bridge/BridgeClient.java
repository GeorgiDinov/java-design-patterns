//The goal is to separate and decouple the dependency from
//the implementation on the abstraction
//Using composition the abstraction HAS A relationship with the implementor
//Again programing to an interface
//That decouples abstraction(abstract class Shape) and implementor(interface Color)
//Color is used in methods in Shape with the needed implementation(RedColor or GreenColor)
//We then can have both Rectangle and Triangle classes that are not forced by the Shape class
//to implement its abstraction but rather use the implementor(Color interface)
