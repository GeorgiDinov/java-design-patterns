//
//Flyweight design pattern when memory is an issue
//Helps with the use of already created objects by reassigning them with new
//"extrinsic" properties from the client that wants to use them
//all of the objects have the same "intrinsic" state(internal state, also something like basic state)
//there is factory method involved which controls creation and distribution of the objects
//the factory class contains all created objects cashed(in our case in a HashMap)
//if the client wants already created object the factory checks the cash and returns it
//in not it creates that object and put it in it's cash(the HashMap)
//then the client adds all the extrinsic state he needs(some kind of setters)
//In our case assign weapon
//If the client needs the same object type but with different outer state the call to the
//factory method will pull out that object from the cash and the new state will be added
//
